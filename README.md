# GetSetPlay- React edition

## Functionality and purpose of this app
This basic app would give musicians an intuitive way to build a setlist with tools other than paper and pen, giving options to rearrange the song order and check the amount of time left after each new song is added.

The basic flow of the app is the following:
- The user types in an initial time for the complete setlist, listed in minutes
- The form on the left lets the user type the name of each song, and its duration.
- On submit, the song is added to the setlist and its duration is substracted from the total time.
- The list will show the amount of time left for more songs after each new entry.

## State of the app and TODO list
This repo includes a Kanban-style card system under the tab 'Projects' (if you are viewing this README on my GitHub profile, this is four tabs to the right of your current view, underneath the Watch/Star/Fork icons)
